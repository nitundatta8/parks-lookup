## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repository from GitHub.
2. Open the downloaded directory in a text editor of your choice.
  (VSCode, Atom, etc.)
3. Make sure that C#/.netcore2.2 is installed on your computer.
4. Ensure that  MySQL Community Server is installed on your computer.
5. 5. Currently, the mySQL database is set up with an appsettings.json file that was not uploaded to Github.  Once you have saved the SQL database on your computer, create an appsettings.json file in the project root directory, and update it with your MySQL installation information in this format:
```
  {
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=[YOUR PORT     NUMBER HERE];database=[DATABASE NAME AS YOU SAVED IT];uid=YOUR USER ID HERE;pwd=YOUR PASSWORD HERE;"
  }
}
```
6. For launching the program navigate to the _ParksLookup_ directory and run ```dotnet build ```.
7. Then run ```dotnet ef database update```.
8. Finaly,run ```dotnet run``` command in the same directory to to open a live server w/auto updated viewing.

#### To Access the Swagger UI:
9. This API uses Swagger. To launch the Swagger/OpenAPI utility in your browser, navigate to the localhost:5000.  You can now see all API routes grouped by controller.  Clicking on a route will expand it and show details of that route, and give you the option to "Try It Out."

#### If you need to install and configure MySQL:
1. Download the MySQL Community Server DMG file [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914) with the "No thanks, just start my download" link.
2. On the configuration page of the installer select the following options:
* Use legacy password encryption
* Set your password
3. Open the terminal and enter the command:
*'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
4. Download the MySQL Workbench DMG file [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484391)
